## **Setup**
1. Familiarized myself with the task requirements and reviewed the contents of each file.
2. Conducted brief research on the packages being utilized.

## **Task 1**
1. Drafted a design for the class on paper, outlining the required class variables and the target method for multiprocessing.
2. Chose to use a queue as the safest method for inter-process data transfer after conducting some brief research.
3. Implemented the changes. However, during the test run, I encountered the error: **"cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object"**. This issue arises because the `multiprocessing` library uses `pickle`, which is incompatible with certain objects.  
   - After researching potential solutions, I discovered that the `multiprocess` library (which uses `dill`) resolves this issue. 
4. Verified the implementation by running a small test:
   - Compared the labels generated by the `SingleProcessDataset` against those from the `Multiprocess` version.
   - Ensured the dataset sizes matched as expected.

## **Task 2**
1. Resolved an error in `main.py`, where the `SimpleNeuralNetwork` class was being instantiated with an unexpected additional argument: `batch_size`.
2. Began researching the formulas necessary for implementing backpropagation. However:
   - I realized that deriving the exact weight-update calculations and implementing them correctly would require more time than anticipated. 
   - Following the guidance in the email, I paused this task at this point.  
   - If more time were allocated, I would continue researching and implement the correct gradient calculation process for backpropagation.
